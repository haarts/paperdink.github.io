1. **ESP32-WROOM-32** module
2. **FCC/CE Certified** WiFi & Bluetooth for connectivity
3. **<20uA** current consumption in sleep mode
4. **CP2104 USB-UART** converter onboard for programming
5. **MicroSD Card** slot for storing images, files, etc
6. **Piezo Buzzer** for notifications and alerts
7. **4x Tactile Buttons** for user input
8. **Battery Charger** circuit to keep it truly wireless
9. **Extension Header** for interfacing and expanding capabilities

## Pin Map

1. UART, SPI, and I2C so you can add external sensors and modules. This makes the board extendable.
2. 8 I/O for controlling any output and receiving any input.
3. Disable ESP32 module using ESP_EN pin to reduce power consumption.
4. Disable the entire board using LDO_EN pin and have virtually no current consumed by the board.

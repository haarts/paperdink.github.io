1. **ESP32-WROOM-32** powerful module
2. **FCC/CE Certified** WiFi & Bluetooth and unlock the full potential of paperd.ink
3. **<20uA** current consumption in sleep mode means longer battery life and more freedom to create
4. **CP2104 USB-UART** converter onboard for easy programming and updates 
5. **MicroSD Card** slot for convenient storage of images, files, and more
6. **Piezo Buzzer** provides notifications and alerts for a more interactive experience
7. **4x Tactile Buttons** for user input and control
8. **Battery Charger** circuit to keep it truly wireless
9. **Extension Header** for easy interfacing and expansion of capabilities, enabling limitless creativity and hacking possibilities.

## Pin Map
<img src="/images/paperd.ink_pinout.png" width="300">

1. UART, SPI, and I2C so you can add external sensors and modules. This makes the board extendable.
2. 8 I/O for controlling any output and receiving any input.
3. Disable ESP32 module using ESP_EN pin to reduce power consumption.
4. Disable the entire board using LDO_EN pin and have virtually no current consumed by the board.

## Interfacing with components
paperd.ink is designed to be power efficient. Thus, the electronic paper display (EPD), SD card, and battery sense circuits are powered by a MOSFET that can be turned off when not in use. All enable pins are active low, meaning they must be set to low to turn on a device. For example, to use the EPD, set EPD enable (pin 12) to low and then set it to high when finished to reduce power consumption.
